    "# Simple LLM Application\n",
    "\n",
    "*Taken from the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/llm_chain/).*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this quickstart we'll show you how to build a simple LLM application. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it's just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\n",

    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses Jupyter notebooks and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "We're deviating from the tutorial a bit here and running this on a local llm. We host an API with ollama and below is the method we'll be using to access it. We also need `langchain` installed. We will not be using `langsmith` as it's a paid service.\n",
