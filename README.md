# Langchain Tutorials

This was my attempt to build a local agent that has tool use and RAG built in. Ran into issues with the way that the ollama api and langchain chat interact that prevent local tool use. 

Going to attempt to use the ollama-python library and write a whole lot of tools myself from here.
